    <div class="center row container">
      <p style="font-size:20px;">Network flows are everywhere, across mathematics, computer science, and operations research. From finding bipartite matchings to modeling traffic to image segmenting, a lot of unique problems can be modeled as a network flow.  Commonly, we wish to find the maximum flow through a given network. There are many different algorithms to do so, but most of them are inherently sequential.  As networks get large, as is the case in many real-life applications, these algorithms may not always have optimal performance, and as such would greatly benefit from a significant speedup from parallelism, which is what this project aims to achieve.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div id="proposal" class="section scrollspy no-pad-bot">
    <h2 class="center cyan-text text-darken-3">Proposal</h2>
    <div class="center row container">
     <p style="font-size:20px;">Parallelizing max-flow algorithms is inherently challenging, as with other graph algorithms, there are many dependencies between nodes, and most common algorithms used for max-flow computations are sequential.  There is some, but not much research on the topic of parallelizing these algorithms. Figuring out how to partition a given graph over workers for optimal parallelization, and minimizing the need for atomicity and communication as much as possible, will be the main challenge.</p>
     <p style="font-size:20px;">The only starter code I may utilize is my parallel BFS and some of the test graphs from Assignment 3. I plan on developing on the GHC machines, which have 8 cores that support hyperthreading (16 logical cores) and a GTX 1080. The GHC machines are perfect, since they are easily accessible, and allow me to test both my parallel CPU and GPU implementations. I will be referencing algorithms that I learned in 15-451, as well as some papers on parallel flow algorithms that I will cite as they are used.</p>
      <p style="font-size:20px;">For this project, I wish to take advantage of parallelism available in modern CPUs and GPUs to obtain a significant speedup in certain max flow algorithms. In particular, I plan on implementing three max flow algorithms in three ways (sequential, parallel for CPUs, and parallel for GPUs using NVIDIA CUDA) - these three algorithms are Edmonds-Karp, Dinic's, and Push-relabel (Goldberg-Tarjan). The first of these algorithms, Edmonds-Karp, is parallelizable between iterations since it uses BFS to find shortest paths. Dinic's algorithm uses BFS as a subroutine as well, and uses the concept of a layered graph to obtain a better asymptotic runtime than Edmonds-Karp. Finally, the Push-relabel algorithm is inherently parallel over vertices, similar to bottom-up BFS, and is already considered one of the most efficient max-flow algorithms, so a large speedup is expected. After implementing all of this, I wish to benchmark the performance of these algorithms on various test graphs (looking at both how the algorithms compare against each other on the same platform, and the speedups obtained from sequential to CPU to GPU). Finally, I want to package these algorithms into a simple C++ library that allows users to easily create graphs and run these algorithms on them (with options to run on CPU or GPU).</p>
      <p style="font-size:20px;">If I have time afterwards, I would like to provide some example use cases of this library, such as finding bipartite matchings and doing image segmentation. If possible, I'd also like to have the library dynamically figure out which algorithm would be better to use based on the input graph's properties, instead of having the user choose the algorithm.</p>
      <p style="font-size:20px;">My demonstration would be showing the various speedup graphs described earlier, both on test graphs, and, time permitting, on the practical examples I will create. The goal is to obtain significant speedups, especially on larger graphs, on all of these algorithms as compared to the baseline sequential implementations.</p>

    <h2 class="center cyan-text text-darken-3">Checkpoint</h2>
    <div class="center row container">
      <p style="font-size:20px;">The updated schedule is above, and includes everything I have completed for this checkpoint. In particular, I have created a basic testing framework, a system to randomly generate connected graphs to be used for testing, and have decided to go with an adjacency matrix representation for my graphs, where entry (i, j) gives the capacity of that edge. This will take up a bit more memory, but makes accesses a lot quicker and more organized than with using my original plan of an adjacency list representation. Finally, I have a sequential Edmonds-Karp implementation that I will use as a baseline correctness test for my other algorithms. I believe I am still on track to produce all of my deliverables - my goals remain the same. The extras I will have a day or two to implement if I stay on track, so I am not sure if those will happen. What I would want to show at the competition is still the same, namely the different speedup plots obtained. Because I have just set up the foundation for my project so far, I don't have any preliminary results. Currently I don't have any issues that are cause for concern.</p>
